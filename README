DESCRIPTION

    This module tries to get song lyrics from api.lyrics.ovh. It's designed
    to be called by Lyrics::Fetcher, but can be used directly if you'd
    prefer.

INTERFACE

    fetch($artist, $title)

      Attempts to fetch the lyrics for the given artist and title from
      api.lyrics.ovh.

      Returns lyrics as a string, or an empty string, if not found.

    agent([$useragent_string])

      Set the desired user-agent (ie. browser name) to pass to the lyrics
      sites - some require you to look like a valid web browser in order to
      respond in order to prevent their sites from being "scraped" by
      programs, such as this. If not set, the current default is:
      "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:80.0) Gecko/20100101
      Firefox/80.0"

      If no argument is passed, it returns the current user-agent string in
      effect.

SPECIAL GLOBAL VARIABLES

    $Lyrics::Fetcher::Error

      Returns a description of the last error that occurred when failing to
      fetch lyrics for various reasons, or "OK" if last operation
      successful.

    $Lyrics::Fetcher::ApiLyricsOph::VERSION

      The current version# of Lyrics::Fetcher::ApiLyricsOph

BUGS

    Probably. If you find any, please let me know. If api.lyrics.ovh change
    their site much, this module may well stop working. If you find any
    songs which have lyrics listed on the api.lyrics.ovh site, but for
    which this module is unable to fetch lyrics, please let me know also.

    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Lyrics-Fetcher-ApiLyricsOVH.
    I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of
    progress on your bug as I make changes.
